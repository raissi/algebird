## <a id="contributing" href="#contributing"></a>How can I help?

The Algebird community welcomes and encourages contributions! Here are a few ways to help out:

- Look at the [code coverage report](https://codecov.io/github/twitter/algebird?branch=develop), find some untested code, and write a test for it. Even simple helper methods and syntax enrichment should be tested.
- Find an [open issue](https://github.com/twitter/algebird/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready), leave a comment on it to let people know you are working on it, and submit a pull request.

See the [contributing guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html) for more information.
