 * [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
   by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason - While this book does not
   specifically cover Algebird, it is a great introduction to functional
   programming in Scala in general and covers some of the abstractions
   that can be found in Algebird.
